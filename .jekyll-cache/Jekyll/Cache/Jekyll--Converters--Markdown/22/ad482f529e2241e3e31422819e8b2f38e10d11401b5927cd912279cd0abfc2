<p>Vagrant is typically used by developers to set up a development environment that matches the production environment.</p>

<p>If you wish to use VirtualBox on Windows, you must ensure that Hyper-V is not enabled on Windows. You can turn off the feature by running this Powershell command:</p>

<p>Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V-All
You can also disable it by going through the Windows system settings:</p>

<p>Right click on the Windows button and select ‘Apps and Features’.
Select Turn Windows Features on or off.
Unselect Hyper-V and click OK.
You might have to reboot your machine for the changes to take effect.</p>

<p>Installing Vagrant is extremely easy. Head over to the Vagrant downloads page and get the appropriate installer or package for your platform. Install the package using standard procedures for your operating system.</p>
