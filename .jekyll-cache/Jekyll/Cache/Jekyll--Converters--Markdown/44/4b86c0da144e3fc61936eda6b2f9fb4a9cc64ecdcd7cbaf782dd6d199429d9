<p>Appium is an open source, cross-platform automation testing tool. It is used for automating test cases for native, hybrid and web applications. The tool has a major focus on both Android and iOS apps</p>

<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How Does it work?</h2>
<p>Appium is a simple HTTP server that is written using Javascript. It follows the generic client-server architecture. The Appium server processes requests from the Appium client and forwards them to the simulator/emulator/real device where the test scripts are automated. The results of the test are communicated to the Appium client through the Appium server, in the form of a server response.</p>

<h2 id="appium-concepts">Appium Concepts</h2>
<p>In the below section, we are going to discuss three key concepts, that are intrinsic to Appium’s architecture.</p>

<h3 id="appium-client-server-architecture">Appium Client-Server Architecture</h3>
<p>Appium at its heart is a server written in node.js. The server works using a client-server architecture. According to the client-server architecture, the client connects to the server to avail any service hosted on the server. Any communication between the client and server is in the form of response and requests.
In Appium the client sends requests regarding automation to the Appium server. The server processes the request in its own unique way, which we will get to in a second,  and then responds with the test result or log files.</p>

<h3 id="appium-sessions">Appium Sessions</h3>
<p>Everything ‘testing’, is done encapsulated in a session. This is pretty obvious given the fact Appium is a simple client and server-based mechanism. The client sends post requests, also known as session requests to the server. These requests carry information in a JSON Object format, and communication is executed using the JSON Wire Protocol.</p>

<h3 id="desired-capabilities">Desired Capabilities</h3>
<p>Appium works differently on iOS and Android. Now since it is a “cross-platform” tool, a mechanism must exist to differentiate between the two operating system’s session requests. This particular problem statement was also addressed with the help of JSON objects, called Desired Capabilities, as shown in the image below.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../img/Architecture/Desired-Capabilities.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Desired Capabilities are key-value pairs of information that distinguish the establishment of a session for the testing of an Android app to that of an iOS app. With arguments like-</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>platformName
deviceName
appPackage
appActivity
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>It becomes fairly easy for the server to distinguish between the two operating systems.</p>
