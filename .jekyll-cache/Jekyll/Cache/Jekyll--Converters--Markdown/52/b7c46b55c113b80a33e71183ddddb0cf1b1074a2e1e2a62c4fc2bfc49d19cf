<p>1.Selenium WebDriver is a browser automation framework that allows you to execute your tests against different browser.</p>

<p>2.WebDriver interacts and controls the actual browser in either locally or remotely.</p>

<p>3.We can use WebDriver to automate and validate Web-Applications.</p>

<h3 id="how-selenium-webdriver-works-internally">How selenium WebDriver Works Internally</h3>

<p>Letâ€™s take a look at the below architecture:</p>

<p><img src="../../../../img/Architecture/large.jpeg" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p><img src="../../../../img/Architecture/SWebDriverArchi.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>The above picture depicts, there are four components of Selenium Architecture:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Selenium Client Library</li>
  <li>JSON Wire Protocol over HTTP</li>
  <li>Browser Drivers</li>
  <li>Browsers</li>
</ol>

<p>We will try to understand each of these four components briefly:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Selenium Client Library</li>
</ol>

<p>Selenium supports multiple libraries such as Java, Ruby, Python, etc.
It means that we can write our code with any of these scripting/programming languages.
Selenium Client Library sends the request in the form of API to the Browser Driver with the help of JSON Wire Protocol over HTTP (hypertext Transfer Protocol).</p>

<ol>
  <li>JSON Wire Protocol over HTTP</li>
</ol>

<p>JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a lightweight data-interchange format which transfers the data between a server and a client on the web.
JSON Wire Protocol is a REST API that transfers the data between HTTP server .Every Browser Driver uses a HTTP server to receive HTTP requests.</p>
