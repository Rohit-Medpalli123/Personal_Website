<h3 id="rewriting-traffic-with-breakpoints">Rewriting traffic with Breakpoints</h3>

<p>Now that we can inspect both HTTP and HTTPS traffic, we can start rewriting responses. The quickest way to achieve this is to use a Breakpoint. These are set up for specific resources (or Locations as they’re called in Charles Proxy) and will pause the response for us to modify before it reaches the client.</p>

<p>You can right click on any level of the resource tree structure to create a breakpoint.</p>

<p>Without any dialogs or notification, this creates a Request &amp; Response breakpoint. You can see the entry (and future ones) from Breakpoint Settings found in the Proxy menu bar item. If you don’t want to pause for requests (I have never needed this), you can configure the breakpoint to be only for responses - double click on the breakpoint entry and uncheck Request.</p>
