<p>Please Restart pycharm to activate all the plugins</p>

<p>Step # 5 â€“ Download Web drivers and Configure browser settings</p>

<p>Purpose of Web Driver: Web driver is a library which helps to communicate between your test automation scripts and browsers</p>

<p>Please download IE web driver</p>

<p>Please download Chrome and Firefox web driver</p>

<p>Create a bin directory(Anywhere) and copy the downloaded web drivers to bin directory and add Path
  (C:\bin) to environmental variables (Advanced system settings â€“&gt; Environment variables â€“&gt; System variables â€“&gt; select Path â€“&gt; click Edit â€“&gt; Add C:\bin directory)</p>

<p>Note: If you add path to Environment variables, Robot framework (SeleniumLibrary) will automatically recognize the web drivers, thereby, you donâ€™t need to explicitly mention web driver path in your test scripts.</p>

<p>OR
We can also add the drivers in the scripts folder of python, As python folder is already added to the Path</p>
