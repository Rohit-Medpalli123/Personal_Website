I"’<p>Vagrant is a command-line tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. By default, Vagrant can provision machines on top of VirtualBox, Hyper-V, and Docker. Other providers such as Libvirt (KVM), VMware and AWS can be installed via the Vagrant plugin system.</p>

<p>Vagrant is typically used by developers to set up a development environment that matches the production environment.</p>

<p>Windows, VirtualBox, and Hyper-V</p>

<p>If you wish to use VirtualBox on Windows, you must ensure that Hyper-V is not enabled on Windows. You can turn off the feature by running this Powershell command:</p>

<p>Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V-All
You can also disable it by going through the Windows system settings:</p>

<p>Right click on the Windows button and select ‚ÄòApps and Features‚Äô.
Select Turn Windows Features on or off.
Unselect Hyper-V and click OK.
You might have to reboot your machine for the changes to take effect.</p>

<p>Installing Vagrant
