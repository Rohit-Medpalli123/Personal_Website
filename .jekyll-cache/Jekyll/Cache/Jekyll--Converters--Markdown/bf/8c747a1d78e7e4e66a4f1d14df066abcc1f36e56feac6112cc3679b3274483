<h3 id="rewriting-traffic-with-breakpoints">Rewriting traffic with Breakpoints</h3>

<p>Now that we can inspect both HTTP and HTTPS traffic, we can start rewriting responses. The quickest way to achieve this is to use a Breakpoint. These are set up for specific resources (or Locations as theyâ€™re called in Charles Proxy) and will pause the response for us to modify before it reaches the client.</p>

<p>You can right click on any level of the resource tree structure to create a breakpoint.</p>
