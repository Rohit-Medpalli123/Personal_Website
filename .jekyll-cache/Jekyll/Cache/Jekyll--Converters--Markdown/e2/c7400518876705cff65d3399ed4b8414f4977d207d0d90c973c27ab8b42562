I"Ÿ<p>Cross-site Scripting (XSS) is a client-side code injection attack. The attacker aims to execute malicious scripts in a web browser of the victim by including malicious code in a legitimate web page or web application. The actual attack occurs when the victim visits the web page or web application that executes the malicious code. The web page or web application becomes a vehicle to deliver the malicious script to the user‚Äôs browser. Vulnerable vehicles that are commonly used for Cross-site Scripting attacks are forums, message boards, and web pages that allow comments.
A web page or web application is vulnerable to XSS if it uses unsanitized user input in the output that it generates. This user input must then be parsed by the victim‚Äôs browser.</p>

<p>If an attacker can abuse an XSS vulnerability on a web page to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a user‚Äôs browser, the security of that vulnerable website or vulnerable web application and its users has been compromised. XSS is not the user‚Äôs problem like any other security vulnerability. If it is affecting your users, it affects you.</p>

<p>Cross-site Scripting may also be used to deface a website instead of targeting the user. The attacker can use injected scripts to change the content of the website or even redirect the browser to another web page, for example, one that contains malicious code.</p>
