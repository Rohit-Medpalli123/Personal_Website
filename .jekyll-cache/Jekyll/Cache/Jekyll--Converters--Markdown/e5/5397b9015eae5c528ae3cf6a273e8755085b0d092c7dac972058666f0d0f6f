I"g<p>Save / Open Charles Proxy Sessions
If you’ve ever been frustrated when trying to reproduce a technical error, being able to save your Charles Proxy session, send it to someone else, and have them open it on their machine to review the same issue is a godsend. I find this is especially helpful if you need to loop in the engineering team’s help, or send evidence of a particular issue to a vendor’s team.  Charles can even open sessions saved in browser based developer tools as well, so you don’t necessarily need to pay for a Charles license for everyone on your team to benefit from this feature.</p>
