I"®<p>This article is a tutorial on how to configure Charles Proxy to inspect traffic over cellular networks, and while itâ€™s designed with ad operations use cases in mind, itâ€™s applicable to any front end web developer with similar needs.</p>

<p>There are many articles out there on how to use Charles Proxy through your phone â€“ Iâ€™ve written two myself, in fact. All those articles assume youâ€™re leveraging a Wifi network when connecting to the internet, however and while thatâ€™s fine for basic testing on mobile web and mobile apps, there are often reasons why you want to inspect traffic over a true cellular network instead.</p>

<p>Perhaps you need to debug an ad that relies on carrier targeting, or you want to measure data usage or network latency through a true cellular connection.  These are more advanced use cases to be sure, but when you canâ€™t get by with using your phone with Charles over Wifi, or a mobile emulator in Developer Tools.  Plus, Charles Proxy offers a host of powerful features like breakpoints, which you can use to test an experience in stages, or rewrite rules to reference a local file before you update your server, or blacklisting, which can be helpful to isolate the root of various technical problems.</p>
