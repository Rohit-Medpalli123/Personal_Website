Cron allows Linux and Unix users to run commands or scripts at a given date and time. You can schedule scripts to be executed periodically. It is usually used for sysadmin jobs such as backups or cleaning /tmp/ directories and more. The cron service (daemon) runs in the background and constantly checks the /etc/crontab file, and /etc/cron.*/ directories. It also checks the /var/spool/cron/ directory.

#### How Do I install or create or edit my own cron jobs?

To edit or create your own crontab file, type the following command at the UNIX / Linux shell prompt:

```
$ crontab -e
```

#### Do I have to restart cron after changing the crontable file?
No. Cron will examine the modification time on all crontabs and reload those which have changed. Thus cron need not be restarted whenever a crontab file is modified.

Syntax of crontab (field description)
The syntax is:

```
1 2 3 4 5 /path/to/command arg1 arg2
OR

1 2 3 4 5 /root/backup.sh
```

Where,

1: Minute (0-59)

2: Hours (0-23)

3: Day (0-31)

4: Month (0-12 [12 == December])

5: Day of the week(0-7 [7 or 0 == sunday])

/path/to/command – Script or command name to schedule

#### Easy to remember format:

* * * * * command to be executed

```
- - - - -
| | | | |
| | | | ----- Day of week (0 - 7) (Sunday=0 or 7)
| | | ------- Month (1 - 12)
| | --------- Day of month (1 - 31)
| ----------- Hour (0 - 23)
------------- Minute (0 - 59)
```

Your cron job looks as follows for system jobs:

```
1 2 3 4 5 USERNAME /path/to/command arg1 arg2

OR

1 2 3 4 5 USERNAME /path/to/script.sh
```

#### Schedule a Job For More Than One Instance (e.g. Twice a Day)
The following script take a incremental backup twice a day every day.

This example executes the specified incremental backup shell script (incremental-backup) at 11:00 and 16:00 on every day. The comma separated value in a field specifies that the command needs to be executed in all the mentioned time.

```
00 11,16 * * * /home/ramesh/bin/incremental-backup
```
    00 – 0th Minute (Top of the hour)
    11,16 – 11 AM and 4 PM
    * – Every day
    * – Every month
    * – Every day of the week

#### Schedule a Job for Specific Range of Time (e.g. Only on Weekdays)
If you wanted a job to be scheduled for every hour with in a specific range of time then use the following.

Cron Job everyday during working hours
This example checks the status of the database everyday (including weekends) during the working hours 9 a.m – 6 p.m

```
00 09-18 * * * /home/ramesh/bin/check-db-status
```
```
00 – 0th Minute (Top of the hour)
09-18 – 9 am, 10 am,11 am, 12 am, 1 pm, 2 pm, 3 pm, 4 pm, 5 pm, 6 pm
* – Every day
* – Every month
* – Every day of the week
```

Cron Job every weekday during working hours
This example checks the status of the database every weekday (i.e excluding Sat and Sun) during the working hours 9 a.m – 6 p.m.

```
00 09-18 * * 1-5 /home/ramesh/bin/check-db-status
```
```
00 – 0th Minute (Top of the hour)
09-18 – 9 am, 10 am,11 am, 12 am, 1 pm, 2 pm, 3 pm, 4 pm, 5 pm, 6 pm
* – Every day
* – Every month
1-5 -Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu and Fri (Every Weekday)
```

```
ramesh@dev-db$ crontab -l
@yearly /home/ramesh/annual-maintenance
*/10 * * * * /home/ramesh/check-disk-space

[Note: This displays crontab of the current logged in user]
```

#### How to Edit Crontab Entries?
