[About SSH](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/about-ssh)

Using the SSH protocol, you can connect and authenticate to remote servers and services. With SSH keys, you can connect to GitHub without supplying your username or password at each visit.

[Checking for existing SSH keys](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys)

Before you generate an SSH key, you can check to see if you have any existing SSH keys.

[Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)

After you've checked for existing SSH keys, you can generate a new SSH key to use for authentication, then add it to the ssh-agent.

[Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account
)

To configure your GitHub account to use your new (or existing) SSH key, you'll also need to add it to your GitHub account.
